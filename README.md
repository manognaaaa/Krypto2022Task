The project currently doesn't include:
  1. Filter and sort options in the products page
  2. Product suggestions based on previous orders
  The above mentioned features are possible improvements to the submission
  
If I were given more time I would wish to:
  1. Include animations that are efficient and swift
  2. Make the UI/UX more user friendly and better looking
