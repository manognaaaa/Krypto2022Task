# Krypto2022Task

Application functionalities include:
  1. Login
  2. Register/Sign-up
  3. My orders
  4. Products page
  5. Wishlist
  6. Cart
  7. Customer feedback
  
The project currently doesn't include:
  1. Filter and sort options in the products page
  2. Product suggestions based on previous orders
  The above mentioned features are possible improvements to the submission
  
If I were given more time I would wish to:
  1. Include and better the animations
  2. Make the UI/UX more user friendly and better looking
