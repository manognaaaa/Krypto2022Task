The project currently doesn't include:
  1. Filter and sort options in the products page
  2. Product suggestions based on previous orders
  3. Quick add option to wishlist
  The above mentioned features are possible improvements to the submission
  
If I were given more time I would wish to:
  1. Include animations that are effecient and swift
  2. Make the UI/UX more user friendly and better looking
